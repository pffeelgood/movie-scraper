# The json files should contain details of movies: 
# (1) with a released date between 2000 to 2024, 
# (2) runtime equal to or over 60 mins. 

# RUNTIME:
# Need to check the values of runtime.
# Some movies have runtime of 0s, I'm not sure if that's because there was no data from TMDb or what.

# Read the json line file with this
with open("2021_results.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    data = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

# First split the data into Global South/North produced with the field 'production_countries'. 
# - Global North: regions/countries Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia (excluding Israel, Japan, and South Korea), and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)
# - There might be more than 1 countries as production countries. If all countries are from North/South, categorise as it is. 
# - If it's North-South co-productions, idk what to do yet, maybe just leave them out for now. 


# Three fields can be used for topic modeling:
# （1） Overview (oneliners of movie descriptions)
# （2） Tagline (not sure if we should use it because 
# most of them are kinda cheesy and don't contain actual information about the movies? 
# maybe experiment modeling on with/without this column.
# （3） Keywords
