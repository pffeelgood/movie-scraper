The json files should contain details of movies: 
(1) with a released date between 2000 to 2024, 
(2) runtime equal to or over 60 mins. 

RUNTIME:
Need to check the values of runtime.
Some movies have runtime of 0s, I'm not sure if that's because there was no data from TMDb or what.

Three fields can be used for topic modeling:
（1） Overview (oneliners of movie descriptions)
（2） Tagline (not sure if we should use it because 
most of them are kinda cheesy and don't contain actual information about the movies? 
maybe experiment modeling on with/without this column.
（3） Keywords
